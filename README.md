# 🧭 Pathfinding Visualizer

> _Explore. Draw. Visualize. Understand._  

**Pathfinding Visualizer** is an interactive React app that helps you learn how common pathfinding algorithms work by visualizing them on a grid. Set start/end points, draw walls, and watch Dijkstra, BFS, and DFS in action.

## ❓ Why Pathfinding Visualizer?

> Understanding algorithms can be abstract and challenging. Visualization bridges the gap by showing each step interactively.

This project helps you:
- Learn and compare popular pathfinding algorithms visually
- Experiment with custom start, end, and walls
- See algorithm exploration and shortest path animations
- Practice building interactive UIs with React
